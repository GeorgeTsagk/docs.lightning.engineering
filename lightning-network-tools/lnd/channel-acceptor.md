# Channel acceptor

LNDâ€™s channel acceptor is a mechanism which you can use to define custom logic with regard to whether an incoming channel should be accepted or not.

This may be useful when restricting channel opens from nodes that meet certain criteria. For example, some nodes may want to restrict channel opens to a desired list of nodes or a specifically defined size. It can also be used to accept channels with a remote channel reserve of zero or to accept zero-confirmation channels.

The channel acceptor is used in Pool to ensure that channels opened through the marketplace have the desired attributes.

[API documentation: Channel acceptor](https://lightning.engineering/api-docs/api/lnd/lightning/channel-acceptor)

In principle, the channel acceptor is relatively simple and does not need to be specifically enabled. When the API endpoints are called (either RPC or REST), a bi-directional channel between LND and the client is established, through which all incoming channel requests are sent.

The client can then respond with either TRUE or FALSE regarding whether the channel should be accepted or not. They can also send a 500 character custom error message to the initiator to inform them about why the channel was denied.

When using the channel acceptor to accept zero-confirmation channels, please note that both the initiator and the respondent must have the following set in their lnd.conf:

`protocol.option-scid-alias=true`\
`protocol.zero-conf=true`

```go
// acceptChannel is the callback that is invoked each time a new incoming
// channel message is received in lnd. We inspect it here and if it corresponds
// to a pending channel ID that we have an expectation for, we check whether the
// self chan balance (=push amount) is correct.

	// just accept it to not interfere with the normal node operation.
	if !ok {
		return &lndclient.AcceptorResponse{Accept: true}, nil
	}

	// The push amount in the acceptor request is in milli sats, we need to
	// convert it first.

	// be trying to cheat.

			Accept: false,
			Error:  errMsg,

	}

	// Check that the channel is a zero conf channel if we were expecting
	// one.
	if expectedChanBid.ZeroConfChannel {
		if !req.WantsZeroConf {
			return &lndclient.AcceptorResponse{
				Accept: false,
				Error:  "expected zero conf channel",

	// parameter.
